# Frontend Mentor - Rock, Paper, Scissors solution

This is a solution to the [Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. In my case, part of the SuperCode bootcamp I am attending was to create a “Rock, Paper, Scissors” project, so I decided to combine the Frontend Mentor challenge with my bootcamp assignment.
